# Veery | *Perform tonight*
## A web app for finding open mic nights, open jams and karaoke nights.

## Why?
I'm impulsive and I love to perform. I loathe the process of trying to find a place sing or play, like right now, because the world needs to hear this new Drake cover that I just learned, but I don't like watching myself on video so youtube is out. *You used to call me on my cell phone.* But let's face it, the local newspaper website is hard to search and slow to load. And I can't remember which bars have an open mic night, on what day is it, Thursday? No, Friday. Facebook? Forget it. I'll get distracted with cat pictures. Twitter? How many apps do I have to open? Is there any place I can walk, or take a cheap Uber ride to? I don't want to drive, just in case one drink turns into three or four. Ugh.

Enter Veely. A program do all this obnoxious legwork for me. Veely will know, *when that hotline bling* that I need a drunk-proof map of all the places close enough for me to definitely not make a fool of myself.

## How?
