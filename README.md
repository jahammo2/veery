# Veery | *Perform tonight*
## Find open mics, open jams and karaoke nights when you're feeling impulsive.

### Why?
I love to perform, but I'm impulsive about it. I loathe the process of trying to find a place sing or play... like right now... because the world needs to hear this new acoustic Drake cover that I just learned... but I don't like watching myself on video so youtube is out. *You used to call me on my cell phone.*

Let's face it, the local newspaper website is hard to search and slow to load. And I can't remember which bars have an open mic night, on what day is it, Thursday? No, Friday. Facebook? Forget it. I'll get distracted with cat pictures. Twitter? How many apps do I have to open? Is there any place I can walk, or take a cheap Uber ride to? I don't want to drive, just in case one drink turns into three or four. Ugh.

Enter Veely. A program do all this obnoxious legwork for me. Veely will know, *when that hotline bling*, that I need a drunk-proof map of all the places close enough for me to definitely not make a fool of myself.

#### What's with the name?
[Veery](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/veery) (*Catharus fuscescens*) is a bird who sings a [downward spiral pattern of beautiful flutey notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK1gaTqBRRk), and [imitates it's own voice to produce something new every time](http://topyaps.com/top-10-birds-known-for-sweet-voice). Sounds about right, and it will probably make a good logo.

#### Why this tech stack?
Who am I to argue with [Atwood's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood)? For the sake of learning some new technologies, we'll use NodeJS and React and an [Isomorphic JavaScript](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/) pattern. This whole project is really about learning these technologies without having to build another TODO app.
